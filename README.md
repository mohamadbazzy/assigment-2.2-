Updates
07/04/2025: Initial release with sentiment analysis capabilities using DistilBERT.
Introduction
Sentiment Analysis API is a lightweight, efficient framework for deploying pre-trained NLP models as RESTful services. Its key features include:

High Efficiency: Leverages Hugging Face Transformers for state-of-the-art sentiment analysis with minimal latency.
Simple REST API: Clean FastAPI implementation providing straightforward endpoints for sentiment analysis tasks.
Collaborative Development: Structured for team-based development with GitHub workflow integration.
Extensible Design: Modular architecture allows for easy integration of additional models and features.

Installation
In a Python environment with supported versions (we recommend 3.8+), install the required packages:
bashCopy# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv env

# Activate it (Windows)
env\Scripts\activate
# OR (Mac/Linux)
source env/bin/activate

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Running the API locally
bashCopy# From the project root
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
The API will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000. You can access the automatic documentation at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.
API Endpoints
Analyze Sentiment
CopyPOST /analyze
Request body:
jsonCopy{
  "text": "Your text to analyze"
}
Response:
jsonCopy{
  "text": "Your text to analyze",
  "sentiment": "positive",
  "score": 0.95
}
Code Example
pythonCopyimport requests

url = "http://127.0.0.1:8000/analyze"
payload = {"text": "I love this product, it works great!"}
headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
result = response.json()
print(result)
# Output: {"text": "I love this product, it works great!", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.97}
Collaborative Development
GitHub Workflow
We follow a structured GitHub workflow for this project:

Feature Branches: Create a branch for each new feature or bugfix
bashCopygit checkout -b feature/add-language-detection

Pull Requests: Submit PRs for code review before merging to main
bashCopy# After committing changes to your feature branch
git push origin feature/add-language-detection
# Then create a PR on GitHub

Code Reviews: All code must be reviewed by at least one team member before merging
Versioning: We use semantic versioning to track changes

Major version: Breaking API changes
Minor version: New features, backwards compatible
Patch version: Bug fixes, backwards compatible
